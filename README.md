# Customer-Segmentation-RFM
 took on the UCI Online Retail Dataset (541,000+ rows) to answer a critical business question: "Who are our best customers, and who are we about to lose?"  Using Python (Pandas) for the ETL pipeline and Power BI for visualization, I built an end-to-end RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) engine.
